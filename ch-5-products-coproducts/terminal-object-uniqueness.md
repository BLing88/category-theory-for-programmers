Let `x` and `y` be terminal objects in a category `C`. Then since each are terminal objects, there exist 
morphisms `m: x -> y` and `n: y -> x`. 

Consider `m`&compfn;`n: x -> x`. Since `x` is terminal, there exists a unique morphism `x->x`. This must be the identity morphism of `x`. Thus `m`&compfn;`n` must be the identity of `x`. Likewise,  `n`&compfn;`m` must be the identity of `y`. Thus `x` and `y` are isomorphic.

Finally, since there can only exist only one such `m` and `n` (since `x` and `y` are terminal), this isomorphism is unique. Therefore, any two terminal objects in category are isomorphic with unique isomorphism.
